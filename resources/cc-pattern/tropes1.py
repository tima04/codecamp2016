# This script generates tropes.csv.

# Tropes are things like a plot twist, a premise, a tic,
# that make a story (e.g., movie, book) more interesting.
# For example: Flexing The Neck Muscles before a fight,
# an Alien Invasion, the Wild West, the Dumbass Has a Point, etc.
# Tropes are the creative product of the writers.
# This kind of knowledge might be interesting for CC purposes.

# There is an online collection of tropes at:
# http://tvtropes.org/

# This script uses CSS Selectors to mine tvtropes.org.
# A CSS Selector is a kind of search query that selects
# specific pieces from a HTML web page.
# For example: "all <a> links that occur in a <li> list",
# or "texts that occur in <p class="review"> paragraphs".
# This kind of script is called a "crawler".

# Take a look at the index of tropes on this page:
# http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes

# The index is organized in a couple of categories (Narrative Tropes, Genre Tropes, ...), 
# each with links to subcategories (Narrative Tropes => Plots, Settings, ...),
# each with links to specific tropes (Plots => Alien Invasion, Everyone Meets Everyone, ...),
# each with links to movies and TV series (Alien Invasion => Stargate SG-1, ...)

# So, what we could do is write a script that:
# 1) visits the index and identifies links to tropes,
# 2) visits the linked trope pages and identifies links to movies,
# 3) visits the linked movie pages,
# etc.

# Take a look at the index of tropes again:
# http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes

# In the browser, enable the Developer Tools.
# For example, in Chrome: from the View menu > Developer > Developer Tools.

# We now get a view of the HTML source code. 
# The Developer Tools have a "magnifying glass" button,
# which allows us to hover over elements on the web page and inspect their HTML.
# We can then use Pattern to download the HTML source code, parse the HTML tree,
# and extract the portions that are interesting (e.g., links) with CSS Selectors:
# http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-web#DOM

# If you don't know about CSS Selectors yet, be sure to read up on them.
# They are extremely useful for data mining.
